## Hi there 👋

**Brandon Travel** is a travel intelligence initiative focused on building open, data-driven tools and resources for travelers, digital nomads, and the global travel community.

We create open-source datasets, APIs, algorithms, and utilities that make travel planning smarter, safer, and more accessible — with a special emphasis on supporting solo travelers.

## 🌍 What We Build

- **Open Travel Datasets:** Curated, structured data on airports, airlines, languages, destinations, safety indicators, and traveler-relevant information.
- **Travel Intelligence Tools:** Scoring algorithms, CLI utilities, automation scripts, and models that help travelers compare destinations, assess risks, track costs, and make informed decisions.
- **Developer Resources:** JSON schemas, API-ready data formats, reference implementations, and open-source packages designed for lightweight integration.

## ✨ Vision

Travel is more powerful when information is open, transparent, and universally accessible.

Brandon Travel is committed to building a global travel intelligence ecosystem that supports more informed travel decisions, better trip planning, inclusive resources for solo travelers, and community-driven data and insights.  

We believe travel knowledge should be open-source — not locked behind paywalls.
